Assynt Achiltibuie Circuit, Scotland. Start point: Achiltibuie. End point: Achiltibuie. Distance: 121,8km. Elevation gain: 2,079m. While Yorkshire is currently gaining all the plaudits on the professional circuit, if you want something a little quieter, it’s time to start looking even further north. Rapidly rising in popularity, Scotland’s quiet and untapped highland roads are unparalleled when it comes to natural beauty. Beginning in the small village of Achiltibuie, prepare for a full day’s riding across an awe-inspiring backdrop of imposing mountains (Suilven, Cùl Mòr and Stac Pollaidh), surging coastal roads and landmarks such as Loch Assynt and the ruins of Ardvreck Castle. Elan Valley, Wales. Start point: Rhayader. End point: Rhayader. Distance: 26,9km. Elevation gain: 239m. This hidden gem will take you far off the beaten track. Following the old Birmingham Corporation Railway line, the Elan Valley is an all-ability bike centre that's one of the best mountain biking spots in Wales. Starting at Cwmdauddwr, the linear trail winds through the valley, taking you over Rhayader Tunnel, a Wildlife Trust Reserve and home to a number of bat species. Continuing through woods and countryside, the track then climbs past Garreg Ddu Reservoir – a great place for a photo of the surrounding valleys – before finishing at Craig Goch Dam. If you're looking for a bit more action, riders can also choose from one of the seven mountain bike routes, including the easy 9km Ant Hills or somewhat harder 60km Elan Epic. Richmond Park, London. Start point: Roehampton Gate. End point: Roehampton Gate. Distance: 10,8km. Elevation gain: 108m. A cycling oasis amongst England's capital, there's no denying that Richmond Park is one of London's most popular cycle spots. Covering 2,500 acres, don't be fooled into thinking that the royal park's short 10.8km loop has nothing to offer. Ideal for novices and club riders, the key to Richmond Park is laps. Choosing the clockwise or anti-clockwise circuit, get ready to face the challenging climbs of either Broomfield Hill (clockwise) or the longer and steadier Dark Hill (anti-clockwise). Whether it's an easy one-lap ride around the tranquil surroundings or a multi-lap training session, be sure to stop for a moment and admire the distant views of St Paul's Cathedral – and if you're lucky, you might even glimpse a sight of the park's famous deer. Applecross via Bealach na Bà, Scotland. Start point: Applecross. End point: Applecross. Distance: 68,5km. Elevation gain: 1,538m. And so we save the best for last. Nobody ever said that discovering the UK’s most beautiful cycle spot was going to be easy, and this 70km ride from the village of Applecross goes to prove it. Voted as one of the world’s best roads, the circuit follows part of the North Coast 500. Dubbed Scotland’s answer to Route 66, the Applecross Loop has it all in abundance: coastal roads, highland landscapes and minimal traffic. But, perhaps the biggest draw of the course is the climb of Bealach na Bà. At just over 9km, Bealach na Bà (it means Pass of the Cattle), rises from sea level to a height of 626m. Often compared to the great alpine mountain passes of the Tour De France and Giro d’Italia, those who dare to take it on will be rewarded with tight switchbacks, 20% gradients and outstanding views of the Isle of Skye.
